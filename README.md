# Kenya-Crime-Prediction-ARIMAX-


This project uses the ARIMAX model to forecast crime rates across Kenyan counties from 2019 to 2023. It leverages external socio-economic and environmental factors to enhance prediction accuracy.

> 🔍 Built for academic research and statistical modeling purposes.

## 📈 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict future crime trends in Kenya using ARIMA and ARIMAX time series models. The study incorporates external variables such as:
- Poverty rates
- Unemployment levels
- Urban population growth
- Education access

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `statsmodels` (for ARIMA & ARIMAX)
- `sklearn` (metrics evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Cleaning, visualization, and trend detection.

2. **Modeling**  
   - ARIMA: Baseline crime prediction  
   - ARIMAX: Enhanced forecasting using external variables

3. **Evaluation**  
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

## 📊 Results & Insights

- ARIMAX outperformed ARIMA in predictive accuracy.
- Strong correlation found between poverty & crime in urban counties.
- Seasonal patterns observed in theft and assault crimes.
